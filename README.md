A fun little photo booth project where you can take photos directly from your webcam on a webpage.

## 🎯 About the Project

This was a longer project. In this project, I created a **photo booth** where you can click photos directly from the webpage. 📸  

I also added some effects, but for now, they are commented out. The only feature currently active is the **green screen**, but it doesn’t have a background to display over yet. There is also a **color picker tool**. 🎨  

If you want, I can uncomment one of the effects. The available effects are:

---

## 🛠️ Available Effects

- **Red Effect:** Increases the red color value in the video.
- **rgbSplit:** A glitch-like color separation effect.
- **globalAlpha:** Controls transparency and opacity of the video, currently set at 0.1.

## 🖼️ Photo Gallery

- There is a **gallery** where the captured photos are displayed.
- You can **click on a photo to download it**.
- ⚠️ Keep in mind: **all data will be erased when the webpage is refreshed.**
